# Background

## Data Science
- Most of tools were created long before the term was actually created.
    + Tukey 1962, Machine Learning/Neural Networks 1960s
- As we collected more data we also increased our processing power (Moore's Law) these tools became more applicable

## Uses of Data Science
### Facebooks newsfood algorithm
- Rohingya crisis
- US elections

## Stating and refining the question

1. Descriptive 
2. Exploratory
3. Inferential
4. Predictive
5. Causal
6. Mechanistic

## Getting your data
- Google is your friend
    + Government websites, Census Bureau, imgnet, Google Books Ngrams, million song dataset
- What if there's a table on a website but its not a tidy data format?
    + Web scraping

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The process of exploring your data by looking at the structure of the data and relationships between variables.

Goals:
- Can I answer the original question with the data I have?
- Are there any problems with my data? Outliers? Missing data?
- Gives you an idea how to answer your question

## Models
Going from the descriptive(plots and graphs) to the prescriptive. Predict what something will do under certain constraints.

### Understanding the data vs Prediction

### Keep it Simple!

### What model to use?
- Highly dependent on context
- What type of data do you have?
    + Shape of data, labeled/unlabeled
- Are we looking for something human understandable?

## Interpret the data
- Did it meet your expectations?
- What is the directionality, magnitude, and uncertainty of the result?

## Communication
- Know your audience
- Be succinct 
- "You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird"
